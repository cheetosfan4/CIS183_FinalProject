## Color Database App, Due 12/14/2025

This app allows the user to do many things related to colors. First, they either have to sign into an existing account, or register for a new account. Then, after signing in, they are greeted with the home page of the application. The user can create colors, manage their own colors, manage their saved palettes, manage their account, or search the app's database. When creating colors, users can save them to different palettes, and even create new ones to save them to. They can choose to favorite any colors they make, or colors from other users. The user can also delete their own colors, delete their own palettes, remove colors from palettes, or unsave palettes made by other users. In the manage account tab, the user can choose to change their password, or delete their account. Deleting an account also deletes all the colors and palettes that user has made. On the search page, the user can use a variety of different filters to search through users, colors, and palettes.
